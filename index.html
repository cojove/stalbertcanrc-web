  <!-- ABOUT GOD -->
  <div id="about-god">
    <h2>About God</h2>
    <p>"We all believe with the heart and confess with the mouth that there is only one God...; he is eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, immutable, infinite, almighty, perfectly wise, just, good, and the overflowing fountain of all good." <em>(Belgic Confession, Article 1)</em></p>

    <p>God reveals himself to us through the creation and government of the universe and through his holy and divine Word as contained in the Holy Bible.</p>

    <!-- Note: add drop down content with verses / explanation? for each point -->
    <p>The life changing message contained in the Holy Bible about God, and his son Jesus, may be outlined in a few key points... </p>

    <div class="key-point">
      God created the world.  He spoke and it came to be.  He made us rulers of the world under him.</em>
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
      We reject God, our ruler, and try to run life our own way.  However, we fail in our attempts to rule ourselves and the world.
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
      God is just and won't let our rebellion go unpunished.  God's punishment for rebellion is death.
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
      God showed his love and mercy by sending his Son into the world: Jesus Christ.  Jesus obeyed God perfectly and died in our place, took our punishment and brought forgiveness.
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
      God raised Jesus to life again and he ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God.  Jesus has conquered death, gives new life, and will return to judge.
    </div>
    <div class="key-point">
      We need to have faith in Jesus and submit to his ruler in order to receive forgiveness and eternal life.
