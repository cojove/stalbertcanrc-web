          <p>At our church you can expect to hear the faithful preaching of the Bible and to enjoy encouragement and
            support from fellow believers. Going to church provides the opportunity to praise and worship God, our
            Creator and Saviour.</p>
          <p>In addition to church services on Sunday, there are many ways to be involved in church life: Bible
            studies, youth groups, committees, special events, service projects, etc.</p>
          <p>Our church was instituted in 2003. We are a member of the Canadian and American Reformed Churches.
